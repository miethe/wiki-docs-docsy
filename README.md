# Welcome to the Wiki Template

This repo hosts the Wiki template. The wiki is built with Hugo and uses the Docsy theme.

## Repo Layout

There are 2 primary branches in this repo: `main` and `gh-pages`.

## Writing Content

Everyone is welcome to write content! And no web dev experience necessary, as all content is written in Markdown!

### Content Creation Process

If you are making edits to existing pages/sections, you can simply submit a PR to `main`. However, if you are adding a new page(s) or section(s), then please create a branch for your work and submit a MR.

All wiki material should be placed in the appropriate section within Docs. If you aren't sure which section in Docs your content fits, please reach out to the wiki admins for guidance.

The best practice for content creation is to create a folder for your new section, with the content written in a new `_index.md` file within the dir. All images can then be placed within the associated dir and referenced from there. And don't forget your Front Matter!
