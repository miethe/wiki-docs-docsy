## What is the Mission of BoxBoat’s OpenShift Practice?
BOP’s role is multi-faceted, like all Practice areas at BoxBoat. However, there are 3 core directives on which BOP focuses its efforts.


1. Enablement & Evangelization - Both Engineering and Sales. Both Internal and External
2. Ensuring Pre-sales & Delivery Excellence
3. Navigating GTM Strategy

## Where to start?
If you're new to BoxBoat, or looking to onboard to BOP, then you should start in [Enablement]({{< ref "/enablement" >}}), especially the [Initial To-Dos]({{< ref "/initial to-dos" >}}) page.

If you're looking to try out OpenShift for yourself, check out [Trying OpenShift]({{< ref "/trying-openshift" >}}) for information on available resources.
