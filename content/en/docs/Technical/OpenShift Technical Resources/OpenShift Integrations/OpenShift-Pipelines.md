## What is it?
OpenShift Pipelines

OpenShift Pipelines provides a native CI/CD platform for creating pipelines for the entire SDLC. Based upon Tekton, Pipelines utilizes CRDs, such as Tasks, to break up components of pipelines into reusable and shareable k8s-native blocks. Together with [[OpenShift GitOps|OpenShift-GitOps]], Pipelines provides a fully featured CI/CD option for OCP-based environments. Also, with the integration of [Tekton Chains](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/cicd/pipelines/using-tekton-chains-for-openshift-pipelines-supply-chain-security.html)/Cosign, Pipelines is capable of native supply chain security with image verification and provenance. Other native integrations include RHACS for additional security (including CVE scanning, admission controllers, policy enforcement, etc), OCI/Quay, Pipelines as Code w/ GitLab/GitHub/etc, GitOps, Logging, etc.


## Red Hatâ€™s Description
Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.
