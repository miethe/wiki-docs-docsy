## What is it?
AMQ Streams, aka OpenShift Kafka, is Red Hatâ€™s event & messaging platform. AMQ is available as both a standalone technology as well as a [core integration](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.1) with a number of products including: [OCP](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.1/html/amq_streams_on_openshift_overview/key-features_str), OCP Data Science, OCP Middleware, and [Red Hat Integrations](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/integration-cloud-native-connectivity-datasheet), as well as other community deployments such as a [Kafka cluster](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.1/html/using_the_amq_streams_kafka_bridge/assembly-kafka-bridge-overview-bridge).
