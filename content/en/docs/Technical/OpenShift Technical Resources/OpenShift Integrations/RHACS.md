## What is it?
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

Based on the OSS Stackrox, which pioneered Kubernetes-native security, ACS is an OpenShift-native container security platform. It provides a powerful suite of security tools in an easy-to-use centralized console, and operates on every aspect of your DevOps ecosystem, from development to build & deploy, and beyond. Whether it's auto-enforcing NIST or CISA/NSA policies, constantly scanning for CVEs and attack vectors, or providing detailed insights into the entire platform, ACS covers all the bases by operationalizing the security of your distributed environment.


## Red Hat’s Description
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)  for Kubernetes is the pioneering Kubernetes-native security platform, equipping organizations to more securely build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications anywhere. The solution’s Kubernetes-native approach lowers operational costs, reduces operational risk, and supports greater developer productivity with built-in security across the entire software development life cycle.
