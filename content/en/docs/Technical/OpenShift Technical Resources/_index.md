OpenShift Container Platform may be just another Kubernetes distribution, but Kubernetes is only a small fraction of the multitude of technologies of which the entire OpenShift ecosystem consists. From the core components of which many distros are comprised, to the numerous optional integrations from Red Hat, to the native 3rd-party integrations from most vendors as well as the community, all plays an integral role in OCP’s position as the foremost hybrid cloud platform for development and orchestration.

With so many technologies at play within OpenShift, even knowing and remembering just all of the  _groupings_ can be futile. Therefore, this page is a living document to centralize these components, organize them, and explain their role and capabilities.

We welcome any and all contributions to this space! If the page exists, add whatever you know or have found. And if it doesn’t, please add it!
