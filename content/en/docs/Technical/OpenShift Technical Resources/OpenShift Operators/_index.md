## What is an Operator?
Red Hat OpenShift Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of instances of Kubernetes-native applications. Operators provide automation at every level of the stack—from managing the parts that make up the platform all the way to applications that are provided as a managed service.


## How are Operators used in OCP?
Red Hat OpenShift uses the power of Operators to run the entire platform in an autonomous fashion while exposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quick installation and frequent, robust updates. In addition to the automation advantages of Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to find, install, and manage Operators running on your clusters.

## What Operators are available?
OCP includes a deployment of [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/), with links to specific Operators that have been Certified for usage on OpenShift. These Operators are provided by a set of Catalogs, as listed in [RH Docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/operators/understanding/olm-understanding-operatorhub.html). Some of which are those available to the community in the OH link above. However, even if an Operator isn’t provided by Red Hat in the OperatorHub, it can still be manually added either directly or via it’s catalog, if supported and developed using the [OperatorSDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).
