Summary
-------

So you want to demo OpenShift? Great! I know you thinking next step is to get a [test environment](/wiki/spaces/OSP/pages/2264563713/Trying+OpenShift) and start showing everything off. However, unless you already have considerable experience across the entire OCP-ecosystem, I urge either taking the time to learn more, or request a demo-er from BOP. Perhaps ask in [#eng-openshift](https://boxboat.slack.com/archives/C6A002Q0L).

When we say that we are demoing OpenShift, 99% of requests are for OCP. There are certainly use cases of just OKE, or the various other forms of OpenShift, but these are likely an entirely different conversation and should be had with a BOP Architect.

Picking a Demo
--------------

There are several ways to demo OCP:

*   **Introductory OCP** - Brief OCP overview, explaining Kubernetes and Containers.
    
*   **OCP: Dev(Sec)Ops in a Box** - Overview of OCP and several popular integrations, assuming foundational k8s/containers understanding.
    
*   **OCP: Developer Experience** - Focus on the Developer view in OCP, and other relevant integrations.
    
*   **Advanced OCP Series: Deep Dives** - Focus on 1-2 OCP Integrations, assuming foundational understanding of k8s/containers, OpenShift/OCP, etc.
