The current version of Hybrid Onboarding is at [Onboarding Curriculum](/wiki/spaces/OSP/pages/2259648513/Onboarding+Curriculum). This document is focused on the full BOP Onboarding.

## Summary
The _BoxBoat OpenShift Practice's_ Onboarding Curriculum is a living document which is tuned from feedback throughout every round of students. The goal is for everyone who completes this training to gain a consistent foundational level of understanding about OpenShift, as well as an individual area of focus. The curriculum is broken up into 3 "weeks", with each taking roughly 5 days of full-time interactivity depending upon the "student". Every week is broken up into various sections:


1. **Coursework**
    1. _Training Content_  (Videos, Slides, Docs)
    2. _Labs_
2. **Technicals**  - Self-led labs following a provided scenario in a provided environment.
3. **Checkpoints**
   1. _Verbal_  - Discussion of Week's content. Identifies student's progress, provides a forum for feedback, and allows expanding upon important focus areas.
   2. _Technical_  - A live demo where the student performs tasks to showcase their new expertise.


The curriculum largely utilizes materials from just a handful of places: Red Hat Partner Training Portal, Red Hat Developer, IBM Developer, and custom content. We are primarily utilizing the first 2 due to the inclusion of a live OCP environment for labs. However, I am pursuing a few different options to allow more custom labs which could follow a similar structure - the primary option being BoxBoat's own training platform,  **CNA**  (Cloud Native Academy).

Every student is assigned a "mentor" during their first day kick-off. This is a Practice member with greater than average experience with OpenShift who has volunteered for the role. This mentor performs all Checkpoints, provides resources for Technicals, and is overall the go-to person during Onboarding. Mentors are also encouraged to develop lab scenarios and help edit the content and layout of the curriculum.

Onboarding is currently being refactored to utilize resources from ITZ, as well as a major refactor to provide more hands-on experience. If you are interested in helping with this initiative, please reach out!

If you are going through the official Onboarding as a New Hire, follow the guidance of your Mentor. The directions here are guidance for self-led discovery of OCP.

Below you will find the current Onboarding curricula. Note, these are still a WIP. Particularly with the move from materials in the Old Curriculum to those in the new. Therefore, for the time being I will include both the Old curriculum and the New. Utilize the primary courses from the New, and utilize the Old as a guide for additional materials in areas you would like to focus.

When possible, focus on the courses which begin with the prefix - DO. IE DO180. These are the paid courses that we have access to for free via the Partner Portal.
