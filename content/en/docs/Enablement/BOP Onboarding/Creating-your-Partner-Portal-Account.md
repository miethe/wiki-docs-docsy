## Summary
Red Hat’s Partner Portal is the primary source of all information and training content which we utilize for enablement. The Portal provides courses on all of Red Hat’s offerings (OpenShift, RHEL, OpenStack, etc), internal documentation behind an NDA, software downloads, NFRs (Not-For-Resale licenses), etc. Additionally, by signing up for the Partner Portal, you create a RH SSO. This allows you access to the entire RH ecosystem, include the Hybrid Cloud Console, Knowledgebase articles, Support, etc. The Portal is also where deals were registered prior to the acquisition.

The easiest way to do this is to get the free community[ RHEL Developer Subscription](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/03/31/no-cost-rhel-developer-subscription-now-available). Do note, it may take 24h or more after sign-up for your access to sync across all environments.

## BoxBoat and/or IBM Accounts
BoxBoat is in a unique situation which allows us access to 2 different Red Hat partner accounts. Prior to the acquisition, we were Red Hat Partners and had our own account. This access has continued, as it allows us greater flexibility with obtaining resources that we may need for internal enablement. However, as part of IBM, we also have access to the standard internal Partner Portal account.

As of ToB (Aug 1st), all Boxboat-ers should create an  **IBM**  RH Partner Portal Account. Follow the instructions on [this W3 site](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/redhat/technical/partner-connect) to create your account. You can also find a copy posted below.

 You may keep your BoxBoat Partner account, or create a new one as desired, but all training should be done via the IBM account to enable tracking of Think 40 hours and accreditations completed.
